# Data_Management
The code used for calculations in my master's thesis is available in this repository.

I added two files. 

The file Thesis_JSchoenmakers.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook file. Calculations for Sections 5.4, 6.2, 6.5, 7.1 and 7.3 can be found in this file.

The file IDM_Effective_Potential is a Mathematica notebook. Calculations for Sections 5.4, 7.1, 7.2 and 7.4 are shown in this file.
